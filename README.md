- The goal of the game is for 1 player to reach 100 points in their overall score to win.
- Each player will roll the dice several times and accumulate a score in the current round. The player can either press hold to save their score or keep rolling with the chance of losing their score in the current round.
- When the player rolls a 1, the score for the current round is lost and it is the next player's turn.
- Repeat until a player reaches a score of 100 to win!
